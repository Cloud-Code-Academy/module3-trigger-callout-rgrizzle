## Lesson 3: Outbound Callouts from Triggers

This assignment focuses on implementing outbound callouts from Salesforce, using Future methods and Queueable Apex, and handling pagination from external APIs.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement asynchronous callouts from Salesforce triggers using @future and Queueable Apex
- Build robust API integration services with proper separation of concerns
- Implement pagination for external API callouts
- Handle error scenarios in integrations
- Create wrapper classes to deserialize JSON API responses

## 📋 Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will be implementing a News Article integration with the NewsAPI.org service. The application will synchronize news articles based on categories defined in Salesforce, using different asynchronous processing techniques.

Your implementation must:
1. Make callouts when News Category records are created or updated with Sync set to true
2. Use @future methods for initial syncs when a category is created
3. Use Queueable Apex for update operations, supporting multi-page sync
4. Store the retrieved articles in Article__c custom objects

## 🔨 Prerequisites

1. A NewsAPI.org API key (sign up at https://newsapi.org)
2. Properly configured Named Credential in your org (see Setup Instructions)

## ✍️ Assignment Tasks

Your tasks for this assignment include:

1. Implement `NewsAPIResponse` class for deserializing the API response
2. Implement `NewsAPIService` class for making callouts to NewsAPI
3. Complete the `NewsCategoryTriggerHandler` class to handle future-based callouts
4. Complete the `NewsCategoryQueueable` class to support paginated callouts
5. Make sure the trigger correctly handles both insert and update scenarios

## 🔑 Named Credential Setup

1. In Salesforce Setup, navigate to **Security > Named Credentials**
2. Click **New Named Credential**
3. Configure with appropriate settings for NewsAPI.org
4. Save the configuration

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- Test classes have been provided for you in the `force-app/main/default/classes/tests` folder.
- `NewsCategoryTriggerHandlerTest` tests the trigger handler for insert and update operations.
- `NewsAPIServiceTest` tests the NewsAPIService class for making callouts to NewsAPI.
- Ensure all tests pass with proper coverage

## 📋 Valid News Categories

The following are valid categories for the NewsAPI:
- business
- entertainment
- general
- health
- science
- sports
- technology

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your implementation should:
- Pass all test methods in the provided test classes
- Properly deserialize JSON responses from NewsAPI
- Create Article__c records from the API response
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Follow Salesforce best practices for integration

## 💡 Tips

- Review the API documentation at [NewsAPI Documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs)
- Use the Developer Console debug logs to troubleshoot
- Test with mock responses before making actual API calls
- Pay attention to error handling for various scenarios

## 🏆 Extra Credit - Optional Challenge

Once you've completed the basic implementation, try these challenges:
1. Add support for additional search parameters
2. Create a Lightning component to display news articles
3. Implement custom logging to track integration activity
4. Add batch processing for handling large volumes of articles
